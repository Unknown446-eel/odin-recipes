    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    Big, bold, and unapologetically messy. Think half-pound patties, charred edges, juicy centers, and toppings that mean business: thick-cut bacon, melty cheddar, grilled onions, maybe a fried egg if you’re feeling outlaw. Served with crispy, hand-cut fries—golden outside, fluffy inside—often dusted with a touch of seasoned salt or smoky paprika.
