    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A silky, tender salmon fillet coated in a glossy honey-garlic glaze that’s sweet, savory, and just a little sticky. The edges caramelize, the inside stays buttery-soft, and the garlic infuses the whole dish with deep aroma. It’s quick enough for a weeknight (15–20 min total) but elegant enough for date night.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 oz Salmon Filet</li>
        <li> 1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li> 1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika </li>
        <li>1/4 tsp blackening seasoning</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp water</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp sriracha sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat salmon dry, then season with salt, pepper, paprika and blackening seasoning (if using). Set aside. </li>
        <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position, then preheat broiler. If you broil this with the rack up high the sauce will burn.</li>
        <li>Add butter and oil to a large, oven-safe skillet over MED-HIGH heat. Once butter is melted, add garlic, water, soy sauce, sriracha, honey and lemon juice and cook 30 seconds or so, until sauce is heated through.</li>
        <li>Add salmon, skin side down (if using salmon with skin), and cook 3 minutes. While salmon cooks, baste frequently with sauce from the pan by spooning it over the top of the salmon.</li>
        <li>Broil salmon for 5-6 minutes, basting with sauce once during the broil, until salmon is caramelized and cooked to desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Garnish with minced parsley if desired.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
